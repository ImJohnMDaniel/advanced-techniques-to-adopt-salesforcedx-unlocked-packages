# Advanced Techniques To Adopt SalesforceDX Unlocked Packages
Original repo name for what has become the [AT4DX Framework Project](https://github.com/apex-enterprise-patterns/at4dx).

The project was moved to its new location because, quite frankly, it was very tedious to type in this long repo name. :sunglasses:

This page was left as a place holder for people who found this repo from the Dreamforce 2018 talk that [@stohn777](https://github.com/stohn777) and I gave entitled "[Advanced Techniques To Adopt Salesforce DX Unlocked Packages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-QoE4l0p0)"
